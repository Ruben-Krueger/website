      <description>I.
Writing is a terrible profession and an even worse hobby. Most writers are underpaid, overworked, and miserable. (I, on the other hand, am overpaid, underworked, and still miserable). But when you write for “fun,” as I do, you do not have the benefit of editors, deadlines, or a dedicated audience. (Should I have used “nor” in this preceding sentence? Who knows!)
I suppose I should explain why I hate writing, even though I offer it as a “passion” of mine when someone asks to describe myself.</description>
