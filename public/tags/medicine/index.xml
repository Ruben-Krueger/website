      <description>I.
Thomas Aquinas once said, &amp;ldquo;beware of the man of one book&amp;rdquo;; Scott Alexander once said, &amp;ldquo;beware of the man of one study&amp;rdquo;; I would like to follow in this tradition with my own aphorism, &amp;ldquo;beware of the man of many aphorisms.&amp;rdquo;
This aphorism is the following: in discussions, when someone makes repeated appeals to aphorisms — e.g., &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t fix what&amp;rsquo;s not broken,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;easy come, easy go&amp;rdquo; — then they likely have no idea what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.</description>

      <description>The medical school application process is broken. In no way is this better exemplified than the secondary application process; or, as I like to think of it, the “cheese grater.”
Applying to medical school is done in multiple stages. The first stage is the primary application, which consists of sending essays (e.g., “why medicine?”), transcripts, and other demographic information to your list of chosen medical schools. After some bureaucratic wrangling by the AAMC — the “non-profit” behind this mess — medical schools send the secondary application to students who have sent their primary application.</description>
