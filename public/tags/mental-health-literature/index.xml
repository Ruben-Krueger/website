      <description>“I believe that suicide is a natural history, a disease process,” Donald Antrim writes in One Friday in April, his recently-published book on his struggles with suicide and depression. Suicide is, in Donald’s words, “not an act or a choice, a decision or a wish.” This, in fact, is the central interrogation of the book: the question of free will for the suicidal man.
The trouble, of course, is that suicide is generally defined as willful self-killing.</description>
