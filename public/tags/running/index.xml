      <description>I love to run. It’s part of who I am. It’s perhaps the most important thing in life to me — without it, I cannot be happy. And this is clear to those that know me; one of my friends once said that running was my “personality.”
Running through streets and trails makes me feel in touch with the outdoors. I generally do not listen to music when I run; I enjoy disconnecting from electronics (save for my watch) and zoning out.</description>
