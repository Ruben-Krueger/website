      <description>For someone who is far (probably) from the end of the road of life, I contemplate my mortality often. Everyday I am reminded that everything I have done, everyone I have loved, and every memory I cherish will disappear with the decay of my neurons.
I do not profess to be a philosopher, scholar, or even someone who is particularly wise. Yet, I do have a piece of advice that many people seem to live their lives without: be parsimonious with your time; spend it like you will never get it back; focus on what you value and the good life.</description>
