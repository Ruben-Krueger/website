      <description>Many years ago, a man, Paul the Publican, opens a pub. To get customers, he puts up a large sign in front of his establishment: “Cheaper than all bars in Oldtown.” For a few years, it worked: his bar is packed most nights. In fact, his prices are so cheap that all of the other bars in Newton close for a lack of business.
However, Paul gets tired of Oldtown and moves the pub to the nearby Newtown.</description>
