      <description>I, like most people during the pandemic, was lonely during the pandemic. Unfortunately, even though lockdowns and social distancing have ended, my loneliness has not. I have struggled with loneliness all my life; however, this past year has been my loneliest ever.
Loneliness is common in our society, particularly in my demographic — young, recent college graduates — though I have the (probably mistaken) belief that mine is uniquely pernicious. One can never feel someone else&amp;rsquo;s pain, but if I had to describe my loneliness, I would say I could feel it in my bones.</description>
