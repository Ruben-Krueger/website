      <description>There are many uncomfortable truths in our callous society. I would like to impart just one to you today: each day, people in our society die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable and they are the consequences of decisions made by pharmaceutical executives, lawmakers, and our political system (this is an argument which I will make in a future post).
Before we explore this uncomfortable truth, I would like to dispel some myths about drug prices.</description>

      <description>If you or a loved one is having thoughts of self-harm, there is help. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255
To write these words is to challenge a belief I hold close to my soul: that language can express the full depth of the Human experience, and in particular, my own as I suffer the withdrawal symptoms of sertraline, a medication to which I became dependent on to soften the torments of my never-ending anxiety.</description>
