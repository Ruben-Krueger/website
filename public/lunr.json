I would like to impart just one to you today: each day, people in our society die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable and they are the consequences of decisions made by pharmaceutical executives, lawmakers, and our political system (this is an argument which I will make in a future post).\n\nBefore we explore this uncomfortable truth, I would like to dispel some myths about drug prices. First, it is undeniable that our drug prices are absurd compared to other nations and the healthcare industry knows this. In a presentation available online, an executive for Kaiser Permanante gave the example of Sovaldi, a medication used to treat hepatitis C. In the United States, Solvadi costs $84,000; in Germany, $66,000; and in Egypt, $900. This phenomenom is not limited to Sovaldi; over the years, cancer drugs have becoming more expensive at \"dizzying rates,\" for instance.\n\nSecond, research and development of drugs is not the only driver of drug costs. While it is expensive to develop a new drug â€” the estimated average cost ranges from $1 billion to more than $2 billion â€” this is a deceitful sleight of hand: most large drug companies spend more on marketing than researching and developing them. \n\n__\n\nIt is now time to take the uncomfortable truth head-on. In a study published in 2020 by the West Health Policy Center and Xcenda, researchers estimated that 112,000 Medicare recipients will die prematurely each year for the next decade due to cost-associated non-adherence to drug therapy (i.e., they cannot afford their medications). As the study noted, this is more people that die from diabetes, pneumonia, or kidney disease. \n\nWhile a shocking statistic, it should not be surprising. A 1993 study found that those without health insurance had a 25% high risk of death, between the years 1975 and 1987, than the privately insured. The analysis controlled for factors such as age, education, and income, as well as lifestyle behaviors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise. A more recent study analyzed the impact of Medicare expansion in certain states after passage of the Affordable Care Act. Unsurprisingly, the authors found a reduction in adjusted all-cause mortality in those adults who received Medicare coverage. \n\nWhile any argument should be based in empirical evidence, the studies above do not capture the true horror of what the effects of unaffordable medication are. In 2016, American Medical Association created truthinrx.org, a campaign to promote transparency in drug prices and collect patient experiences on paying for medications, which you can read on the website. There are dozens of stories, and although they are unique, Myra's is illustrative:\n\n \"Sometimes I decide whether I'm going to get medication or pay my electric bill. An electric bill weighs on me a little bit more because I don't want to be in the dark... I don't know what it feels like to be out of pain, because I live with it every day.\" \n\nNotice, however, that our uncomfortable truth does not spare even those with insurance, as Daniel explains: \n\n \"I have to tell the pharmacy to keep my prescriptions because even with insurance I can't afford them.\" \n\nAnd now it is time for my own story, which was the impetus for this article. Because of a temporary lack of health insurance, I had to pay the full cost of my sertraline prescription, which I take for my generalized anxiety disorder. (You can read about my recent withdrawal from the medication here). \n\nSertraline is a generic drug and was approved by the FDA in 1999 (coincidently, the same year I was born). Despite the fact that it is not new nor novel (in 2016, it was the most commonly prescribed psychiatric medication), the price at CVS without insurance was $141, whereas in Canada, the drug costs $25. I was able to afford the medication, but many people are notâ€” at the federal minimum wage, that is almost twenty hours of work.\n\n___\n\nWhen confronted with uncomfortable truths, we can choose to ignore them or act upon them. But now, dear reader, regardless of what you decide to do, you must live for the rest of your days knowing that people like you are dying everyday, not because Medicine does not have an answer, but because our society chooses to let them die.\n\nThis is only partly a proclamation of despair and resentment. Because each one of us is a small cog, I am not optimistic in a revolution to change the health care machine anytime soon. But for the average patient, I do have some advice: 1) use GoodRx.com to get coupons for prescription drugs 2) use the limited ways available to reduce medical debt.\n\nBeyond this, I only see reason for despair.\n\n",

You may end up feeling electricity course through your cranium without your consent.'\n---\n\nIf you or a loved one is having thoughts of self-harm, there is help. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255\n\nTo write these words is to challenge a belief I hold close to my soul: that language can express the full depth of the Human experience, and in particular, my own as I suffer the withdrawal symptoms of sertraline, a medication to which I became dependent on to soften the torments of my never-ending anxiety. Words have always failed me when I try to explain why my anxiety leaves me unable to function, and why this anxiety is not caused by anything I'm thinking about. Yet this episode leaves me to conclude that when describing the insides of my head, words are inadequate.\n\nI wish I could say that my breakup with sertraline was a protest against the pharmaceutical industry or a detox from all mind-altering substances. Yet this is not the case. A lapse in health insurance coverage (entirely due to my oversight) caused me to stop taking the drug. As a result, I am discontinuing sertraline without a doctor's approval; and because of my temporary lack of insurance, no doctor to confess my withdrawal symptoms to.\n\nWhile my experience is common for those who stop taking sertraline â€” it is known as SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome â€” I did not anticipate such a diverse and weird set of symptoms over the past few days: upset stomach, fever, headache, fatigue, malaise, decreased appetite, and most peculiar of all, a zapping sensation in my brain. (Notice, though, a lack of anxiety; my mind must have a sense of humor.)\n\nSertraline (brand-name: Zoloft) is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). A neuroscientist will explain that this means the drug will increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, hopefully improving mood and other symptoms. A clinician will explain this drug is used to treat depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other afflictions. And I will explain that these descriptions are a poor exercise in intellectualization: my mind feels like a cauldron of capricious chemicals, upset by stochastic processes unbeknownst to myself, and that I resent Science for failing to provide more answers.\n\nIt has been five days since I stopped taking my anxiety medication. Because I have not had a relapse of the debilitating anxiety which led me to start taking it six months ago, I have decided to continue this experiment. I do not know when the withdrawal symptoms will end. Nor do I know when our society will treat psychiatric conditions with the same respect as somatic ones. Regardless, I hope both come soon â€” for my sake as much as yours.\n\nIn short, dear reader, do not stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. You may end up feeling electricity course through your cranium without your consent. \n",

From the inception of the pandemic, public health officials have fought against the biological danger of COVID-19 as much as the lies and deception created about COVID-19.\n\nI was reminded of this reality when I was sitting in the examining room of a Bay Area hospital, where I was shadowing a physician. The doctor â€” letâ€™s call him Dr. Joe â€” was conducting a phone visit with a patient. After addressing the patientâ€™s chronic pain issues, Dr. Joe asked the patient about his vaccine status, a standard inquiry for any appointment these days.\n\nThe patient was not vaccinated, much to Dr. Joe's disappointment. The patient cited the hesistance of his family members and information he had heard on Fox News as reasons for not getting the vaccine. The rest of the visit was consumed with Dr. Joe trying to convince the patient to get the vaccine, the ultimate test of stoicism and one's ability to debunk vaccine misinformation. The call ended without a clear answer on whether or not the patient will get the vaccine; in any case, it's emblematic of a larger issue.\n  \n  Fox News and COVID-19 misinformation\n\n \n\n  \nFox News has been one of the largest sources of misinformation during the pandemic. Their lies have been willful, consistent, and worst of all, shameless. During the initial stage of the pandemic, America's Most-Watched Cable Network downplayed the seriousness of the disease, questioned widely-accepted safety measures like masks, and recently, have campaigned against vaccines. The Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, has decried anti-vaccine misinformation by right-wing outlets such as Fox News as â€˜reckless.â€™\n\n  \nFreedoms\n\n When a man drinks a fifth of vodka, swerves into an oncoming lane and kills a family of four, he will face trial for manslaughter. When a right-wing pundit lies about the vaccine and their viewers die from COVID because they were unvaccinated, should there not also be consequences?\n  \nWhile our public health officials have not been perfect in their COVID-19 messaging (no one has articulated this better than the sociologist Zeynep Tufkeci), it is undeniable the harm that certain media outlets have caused.\n\nMedia pundits have a variety of reasons for spreading vaccine misinformation: ratings, political persuasion, their own ignorance. Regardless of the reason, it has forced many people like Dr. Joe to be both doctors and PR reps for science. \n",

Each has their strengths and weaknesses, and I've used almost all of them: Wix, Squarespace, React, Vue, Bootstrap, to name a few. On my previous personal websites, I would use a template like this and customize it.\n\nHowever, this approach does not lend itself to making a blog, where content needs to be served dynamically.  Moreover, I wanted an easy method of automated deployments from a git repo. Thus, a couple weeks ago I decided to try something new. \n\nBuilding the site: Hugo\n\nBefore this site, there was one major website development tool that I had never used: static site generators. Static site generators are tools that build websites from templates and user-created data (generally Markdown). Static site generators are a common way of making blogs, API documentation, and more. There are a large number of static site generators out there, but Jekyll and Hugo are among the most popular. I was too busy (read: lazy) to fix my Ruby environment on my Mac, so I went with Hugo, which is powered by Go.\n\nTo get started with Hugo, follow these instructions. Once you have created a Hugo website, you will be presented with this folder structure:\n\nFiles like images will be stored in /static and /content is where you write markdown, which is styled according to your template. Next, you will need to add a theme. I use the Winston theme, but there are a lot of other great options. The final generated HTML and other resources gets put into /public, which will ultimately be served to the client.  After you do run hugo, the deployment-ready site is available there.\n\n The themes available will make or break your website. When deciding on a static site generator, first pick one with a template that you like.\n\n Deploying \n\nI used Netlify to host this website, as there is a great free tier and easy deployments using Github. Once you have it deployed, it will be available at a url like https://pensive-gates-f6191a.netlify.app. While pensive-gates-f6191a.netlify.app is a great name, it's not the easiest to remember. Thus, you can follow these steps to add a custom domain. \n\nConclusion\n\nBuilding websites can be confusing and frustrating, which has led to the profileration of no-code sites like Webflow and Wix. Overall, I have found Hugo to be an excellent static site generator and will be using it for more projects. \n\n",

The classic example is the comments section of a political YouTube video, where interlocuters compare each other to historical tyrants. In Jamie Bartlett's book The Dark Net, the journalist explores the Dark Net, which he defines as \"internet underworlds set apart yet connected to the internet we inhabit, worlds of freedom and anonymity... often uncensored unregulated and outside societys norms.\"\n\nThe book begins with a short history of the internet, including the impact of Bulletin Board Systems and the cypherpunk movement â€” an idealogy centering around cryptography and libertarianism. The cypherpunk movement epitomizes the central question implicit in the book: to whom do we give the power of the internet to, average users or a central authority, like government? \n\nAlong the book's mostly predictable path, the usual crimes and taboos of society are explored: trolling, child abuse imagery, hackers, drugs, and pornography. In one chapter, Jamie orders a small amount of marijuana on the Silk Road 2.0 to illustrate the ease and professionalism of illegal drug marketplaces. In another, he visits \"Paul,\" a British-man who spreads his far-right views using Facebook, blogs, and other easily-accesible sites. \n\nPaul's story illustrates the true danger of the internet, more so than any of the other topics discussed. While the book was published in 2014, in 2021 we see that the internet has created violent extremism and misinformation on levels never seen before. This misinformation includes lies about COVID-19 and vaccines, which proliferate on Facebook, while the extremism includes ISIS propaganda and neo-Nazism.  \n\nIn response to Bartlett's definition of the Dark Net, I posit my own definition, the Darkest Net:\n\n The Darkest Net is the internet that brings out the worst parts of ourselves: the social media feeds which increase political polarization, messaging platforms which leave users feeling lonely, and feedback mechanisms that leave some addicted to the internet.\n\nWhile it is easy to condemn the Dark Net, this is not the case with the Darkest Net, as we all inhabit the Darkest Net. We all share misinformation on Facebook, argue in comment threads, and seek information which confirms our own biases. This is not to say the internet is a deleterious place, but one in which we need to be careful in (and arguably, deservering of more regulation).\n",

Shouldn't information sharing increase and ideas be generated more easily? One would think so â€”Â is this not a benefit of working in a virtual environment?\n\nWhether or not knowledge workers will return back to the office is hotly debated right now. Major companies like Apple and Google have delayed their plans to return back to office, and regardless of the ultimate outcome, our relationship to where we work has fundamentally been changed. A common argument in favor of remote work is that since workers can be just as productive at home, why pay the time and expense of working from a cubicle?\n\nA recent study by Microsoft has complicated such claims. Researchers analyzed communication data of Microsoft employees, such as time spent in meetings and emails sent, before and after the pandemic lockdowns in March of 2020. In short, they found that the groups of people who worked together became \"more static and siloed\" and that this may impede information-sharing across the company. To make sense of  this result, we will turn to a foundation of computer science: graphs. \n\nIn computer science, a graph is a data structure represented by nodes (circles) and edges (lines). These graphs can model a wide range of entities: cities and roads, people and friendships, computers and ethernet cables. In the below graph, we have \"Tech-R-Us,\" a hypothetical tech company. Each node (circle) represents an employee and each edge (line) represents a personal relationship â€” two people who meet about increasing conversions, for instance.  \n\nIn the above scenario, everyone knows everyone else, or at least knows someone who knows that other person. (Of course, in a company with 180,000 employees like Microsoft, this would be impossible). If someone on the mobile development team needs to understand why a server has a certain bug, it will not take them long to find someone on the server team who knows why.\n\nAccording to the Microsoft study, when the remote work revolution happened, Tech-R-Us would look more like this:\n\nIn other words, each team is interacting less with the other teams. And when workers do interact, it tends to be over asynchronous methods, like email. With these observations, they make the conclusion information sharing will be impeded. Why does information sharing matter? Knowledge work is all about information sharing and the generation of ideas.\n\nWithout a doubt, remote workers can be very productive. But this is not so clear over the long term. There is research which shows that the consolidation of inventors into superstar cities like San Francisco \nhas boosted the number of patents created, compared to the case when inventors are spread evenly across the country. It seems to me that this is a phenomenon which is more powerful than the ping of a Slack message. \n\nRemotely Alone\n\nThe remote work revolution has implications beyond our economy as well. In the ground-breaking book, \"Bowling Alone\", the political scientist Robert Putnam describes the disintegration of traditional social ties such as the church and â€” as the title would suggest â€” bowling leagues. This trend has worsened and loneliness is now described as an \"epidemic\".\n\nIn a society where we are \"bowling alone\" we should not also \"work alone.\" Yes, there are times when remote work is necessary â€” during a pandemic or when childcare is unavailable, for example. But when the number of ties in our social networks (not on Facebook, but real life) is decreasing, we need to focus on our in-person relationships, not virtual ones.\n\nRemote work has been touted by some as the triumph of the employee over the employer. The freedom to work from home has been framed as a way to spend less time in traffic and more time with family. In many cases this true. But in other cases, it is patently wrong. In the fight between labor and capital, we must not forget who we are fighting against, but who we are fighting with: our coworkers. \n\n",
