      <description>Two men were sitting at the bar after work, as men do. The first man, Larry the Lawyer, was bemoaning his day. “Oh, how much of the legal profession is drudgery,” he said. “I spend hours of my day filing useless motions then spend even more time in court on behalf of clients who commit the most heinous acts,” he continued.
The other man, Barry Bottle Cap, nodded and sipped his beer.</description>

      <title>Beware of the Man of Many Aphorisms</title>

      <description>I.
Thomas Aquinas once said, &amp;ldquo;beware of the man of one book&amp;rdquo;; Scott Alexander once said, &amp;ldquo;beware of the man of one study&amp;rdquo;; I would like to follow in this tradition with my own aphorism, &amp;ldquo;beware of the man of many aphorisms.&amp;rdquo;
This aphorism is the following: in discussions, when someone makes repeated appeals to aphorisms — e.g., &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t fix what&amp;rsquo;s not broken,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;easy come, easy go&amp;rdquo; — then they likely have no idea what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.</description>

      <title>On Running</title>

      <description>I love to run. It’s part of who I am. It’s perhaps the most important thing in life to me — without it, I cannot be happy. And this is clear to those that know me; one of my friends once said that running was my “personality.”
Running through streets and trails makes me feel in touch with the outdoors. I generally do not listen to music when I run; I enjoy disconnecting from electronics (save for my watch) and zoning out.</description>

      <title>The Cheese Grater</title>

      <description>The medical school application process is broken. In no way is this better exemplified than the secondary application process; or, as I like to think of it, the “cheese grater.”
Applying to medical school is done in multiple stages. The first stage is the primary application, which consists of sending essays (e.g., “why medicine?”), transcripts, and other demographic information to your list of chosen medical schools. After some bureaucratic wrangling by the AAMC — the “non-profit” behind this mess — medical schools send the secondary application to students who have sent their primary application.</description>

      <title>On Writing</title>

      <description>I.
Writing is a terrible profession and an even worse hobby. Most writers are underpaid, overworked, and miserable. (I, on the other hand, am overpaid, underworked, and still miserable). But when you write for “fun,” as I do, you do not have the benefit of editors, deadlines, or a dedicated audience. (Should I have used “nor” in this preceding sentence? Who knows!)
I suppose I should explain why I hate writing, even though I offer it as a “passion” of mine when someone asks to describe myself.</description>

      <title>Suicide, the disease</title>

      <description>“I believe that suicide is a natural history, a disease process,” Donald Antrim writes in One Friday in April, his recently-published book on his struggles with suicide and depression. Suicide is, in Donald’s words, “not an act or a choice, a decision or a wish.” This, in fact, is the central interrogation of the book: the question of free will for the suicidal man.
The trouble, of course, is that suicide is generally defined as willful self-killing.</description>

      <title>January 6th: A Story Mistold</title>

      <description>Humans understand the world through stories. These may be ones of heroism, failure, or both; regardless, it is not sober facts that inspire action in us, but narratives. The events of January 6th, 2021 show a disturbing tale believed by some Americans.
In a “Save America” rally that day, Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell” to, well, save their country. This was the story that thousands of right-wing militia men, real estate agents, and veterans told themselves: the election was stolen, Trump is our president, and we must return him to power.</description>

      <title>An Uncomfortable Truth</title>

      <description>There are many uncomfortable truths in our callous society. I would like to impart just one to you today: each day, people in our society die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable and they are the consequences of decisions made by pharmaceutical executives, lawmakers, and our political system (this is an argument which I will make in a future post).
Before we explore this uncomfortable truth, I would like to dispel some myths about drug prices.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Remote Work Explained with Graphs</title>

      <description>When you are able to reach anyone in your remote organization instantly through Slack or email, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t barriers across teams and locations disappear? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t information sharing increase and ideas be generated more easily? One would think so — is this not a benefit of working in a virtual environment?
Whether or not knowledge workers will return back to the office is hotly debated right now. Major companies like Apple and Google have delayed their plans to return back to office, and regardless of the ultimate outcome, our relationship to where we work has fundamentally been changed.</description>

      <title>The Darkest Net</title>

      <description>One does not have to spend long on the internet to see vile, offensive, or otherwise malicious content. The classic example is the comments section of a political YouTube video, where interlocuters compare each other to historical tyrants. In Jamie Bartlett&amp;rsquo;s book The Dark Net, the journalist explores the Dark Net, which he defines as &amp;ldquo;internet underworlds set apart yet connected to the internet we inhabit, worlds of freedom and anonymity&amp;hellip; often uncensored unregulated and outside societys norms.</description>

      <description>Lies There are unknown lies; there are known lies; and there are known lies which lead to the deaths of countless people. From the inception of the pandemic, public health officials have fought against the biological danger of COVID-19 as much as the lies and deception created about COVID-19.
I was reminded of this reality when I was sitting in the examining room of a Bay Area hospital, where I was shadowing a physician.</description>
