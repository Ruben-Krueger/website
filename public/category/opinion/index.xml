      <description>For someone who is far (probably) from the end of the road of life, I contemplate my mortality often. Everyday I am reminded that everything I have done, everyone I have loved, and every memory I cherish will disappear with the decay of my neurons.
I do not profess to be a philosopher, scholar, or even someone who is particularly wise. Yet, I do have a piece of advice that many people seem to live their lives without: be parsimonious with your time; spend it like you will never get it back; focus on what you value and the good life.</description>

      <description>There are many uncomfortable truths in our callous society. I would like to impart just one to you today: each day, people in our society die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable and they are the consequences of decisions made by pharmaceutical executives, lawmakers, and our political system (this is an argument which I will make in a future post).
Before we explore this uncomfortable truth, I would like to dispel some myths about drug prices.</description>

      <description>When you are able to reach anyone in your remote organization instantly through Slack or email, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t barriers across teams and locations disappear? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t information sharing increase and ideas be generated more easily? One would think so — is this not a benefit of working in a virtual environment?
Whether or not knowledge workers will return back to the office is hotly debated right now. Major companies like Apple and Google have delayed their plans to return back to office, and regardless of the ultimate outcome, our relationship to where we work has fundamentally been changed.</description>

      <description>One does not have to spend long on the internet to see vile, offensive, or otherwise malicious content. The classic example is the comments section of a political YouTube video, where interlocuters compare each other to historical tyrants. In Jamie Bartlett&amp;rsquo;s book The Dark Net, the journalist explores the Dark Net, which he defines as &amp;ldquo;internet underworlds set apart yet connected to the internet we inhabit, worlds of freedom and anonymity&amp;hellip; often uncensored unregulated and outside societys norms.</description>

      <description>Lies There are unknown lies; there are known lies; and there are known lies which lead to the deaths of countless people. From the inception of the pandemic, public health officials have fought against the biological danger of COVID-19 as much as the lies and deception created about COVID-19.
I was reminded of this reality when I was sitting in the examining room of a Bay Area hospital, where I was shadowing a physician.</description>
