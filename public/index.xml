      <title>On Loneliness</title>

      <description>I, like most people during the pandemic, was lonely during the pandemic. Unfortunately, even though lockdowns and social distancing have ended, my loneliness has not. I have struggled with loneliness all my life; however, this past year has been my loneliest ever.
Loneliness is common in our society, particularly in my demographic — young, recent college graduates — though I have the (probably mistaken) belief that mine is uniquely pernicious. One can never feel someone else&amp;rsquo;s pain, but if I had to describe my loneliness, I would say I could feel it in my bones.</description>

      <title>On Writing</title>

      <description>I.
Writing is a terrible profession and an even worse hobby. Most writers are underpaid, overworked, and miserable. (I, on the other hand, am overpaid, underworked, and still miserable). But when you write for “fun,” as I do, you do not have the benefit of editors, deadlines, or a dedicated audience. (Should I have used “nor” in this preceding sentence? Who knows!)
I suppose I should explain why I hate writing, even though I offer it as a “passion” of mine when someone asks to describe myself.</description>

      <title>Suicide, the disease</title>

      <description>“I believe that suicide is a natural history, a disease process,” Donald Antrim writes in One Friday in April, his recently-published book on his struggles with suicide and depression. Suicide is, in Donald’s words, “not an act or a choice, a decision or a wish.” This, in fact, is the central interrogation of the book: the question of free will for the suicidal man.
The trouble, of course, is that suicide is generally defined as willful self-killing.</description>

      <title>January 6th: A Story Mistold</title>

      <description>Humans understand the world through stories. These may be ones of heroism, failure, or both; regardless, it is not sober facts that inspire action in us, but narratives. The events of January 6th, 2021 show a disturbing tale believed by some Americans.
In a “Save America” rally that day, Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell” to, well, save their country. This was the story that thousands of right-wing militia men, real estate agents, and veterans told themselves: the election was stolen, Trump is our president, and we must return him to power.</description>

      <title>A Simple Guide to Webscraping With Python</title>

      <description>Webscraping is the process of pulling data from websites, typically using a script. Webscraping is a wonderful thing: like many other automations, you can save hours (or more) of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this skill to be incredible useful, as I&amp;rsquo;ve applied it to many different projects. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to write a Python script that creates a CSV file of data from a fake online bookstore. This tutorial assumes that you understand the basics of Python (e.</description>

      <title>An Uncomfortable Truth</title>

      <description>There are many uncomfortable truths in our callous society. I would like to impart just one to you today: each day, people in our society die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable and they are the consequences of decisions made by pharmaceutical executives, lawmakers, and our political system (this is an argument which I will make in a future post).
Before we explore this uncomfortable truth, I would like to dispel some myths about drug prices.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Remote Work Explained with Graphs</title>

      <description>When you are able to reach anyone in your remote organization instantly through Slack or email, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t barriers across teams and locations disappear? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t information sharing increase and ideas be generated more easily? One would think so — is this not a benefit of working in a virtual environment?
Whether or not knowledge workers will return back to the office is hotly debated right now. Major companies like Apple and Google have delayed their plans to return back to office, and regardless of the ultimate outcome, our relationship to where we work has fundamentally been changed.</description>

      <title>The Darkest Net</title>

      <description>One does not have to spend long on the internet to see vile, offensive, or otherwise malicious content. The classic example is the comments section of a political YouTube video, where interlocuters compare each other to historical tyrants. In Jamie Bartlett&amp;rsquo;s book The Dark Net, the journalist explores the Dark Net, which he defines as &amp;ldquo;internet underworlds set apart yet connected to the internet we inhabit, worlds of freedom and anonymity&amp;hellip; often uncensored unregulated and outside societys norms.</description>

There are no shortage of front-end frameworks, no-code website builders, and website templates available. Each has their strengths and weaknesses, and I&amp;rsquo;ve used almost all of them: Wix, Squarespace, React, Vue, Bootstrap, to name a few. On my previous personal websites, I would use a template like this and customize it.
However, this approach does not lend itself to making a blog, where content needs to be served dynamically.</description>

      <description>Lies There are unknown lies; there are known lies; and there are known lies which lead to the deaths of countless people. From the inception of the pandemic, public health officials have fought against the biological danger of COVID-19 as much as the lies and deception created about COVID-19.
I was reminded of this reality when I was sitting in the examining room of a Bay Area hospital, where I was shadowing a physician.</description>

      <description>Pithy observations and questions that I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering. Some of these may be the start of a blog post :)
 Airplanes are too loud and there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough leg room.
How do we reduce the bifurication of our economy into high-paid knowledge workers and low-paid service workers?
Should we breakup Facebook?
How do we reduce political polarization, given the incentives of social media companies and right-wing media?</description>
