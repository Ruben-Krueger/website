      <description>As I climbed another steep trail, muddy and filled with rocks — forcing me to walk, once again — I reminded myself I signed up for this. I paid money to do this.
To be sure, Tilden Regional Park is stunningly beautiful — a “crown jewel” park with miles of forest trails next to Berkeley — but this I could not enjoy, as I only looked forward to reuniting with my car, where I had stored coconut water and granola bars.</description>

      <description>For someone who is far (probably) from the end of the road of life, I contemplate my mortality often. Everyday I am reminded that everything I have done, everyone I have loved, and every memory I cherish will disappear with the decay of my neurons.
I do not profess to be a philosopher, scholar, or even someone who is particularly wise. Yet, I do have a piece of advice that many people seem to live their lives without: be parsimonious with your time; spend it like you will never get it back; focus on what you value and the good life.</description>

      <description>Webscraping is the process of pulling data from websites, typically using a script. Webscraping is a wonderful thing: like many other automations, you can save hours (or more) of work. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this skill to be incredible useful, as I&amp;rsquo;ve applied it to many different projects. In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to write a Python script that creates a CSV file of data from a fake online bookstore. This tutorial assumes that you understand the basics of Python (e.</description>

      <title>An Uncomfortable Truth</title>

      <description>There are many uncomfortable truths in our callous society. I would like to impart just one to you today: each day, people in our society die because they cannot afford prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable and they are the consequences of decisions made by pharmaceutical executives, lawmakers, and our political system (this is an argument which I will make in a future post).
Before we explore this uncomfortable truth, I would like to dispel some myths about drug prices.</description>

      <description>If you or a loved one is having thoughts of self-harm, there is help. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255
To write these words is to challenge a belief I hold close to my soul: that language can express the full depth of the Human experience, and in particular, my own as I suffer the withdrawal symptoms of sertraline, a medication to which I became dependent on to soften the torments of my never-ending anxiety.</description>

      <description>When you are able to reach anyone in your remote organization instantly through Slack or email, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t barriers across teams and locations disappear? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t information sharing increase and ideas be generated more easily? One would think so — is this not a benefit of working in a virtual environment?
Whether or not knowledge workers will return back to the office is hotly debated right now. Major companies like Apple and Google have delayed their plans to return back to office, and regardless of the ultimate outcome, our relationship to where we work has fundamentally been changed.</description>

      <title>The Darkest Net</title>

      <description>One does not have to spend long on the internet to see vile, offensive, or otherwise malicious content. The classic example is the comments section of a political YouTube video, where interlocuters compare each other to historical tyrants. In Jamie Bartlett&amp;rsquo;s book The Dark Net, the journalist explores the Dark Net, which he defines as &amp;ldquo;internet underworlds set apart yet connected to the internet we inhabit, worlds of freedom and anonymity&amp;hellip; often uncensored unregulated and outside societys norms.</description>

      <title>How I Made This</title>

There are no shortage of front-end frameworks, no-code website builders, and website templates available. Each has their strengths and weaknesses, and I&amp;rsquo;ve used almost all of them: Wix, Squarespace, React, Vue, Bootstrap, to name a few. On my previous personal websites, I would use a template like this and customize it.
However, this approach does not lend itself to making a blog, where content needs to be served dynamically.</description>

      <description>Lies There are unknown lies; there are known lies; and there are known lies which lead to the deaths of countless people. From the inception of the pandemic, public health officials have fought against the biological danger of COVID-19 as much as the lies and deception created about COVID-19.
I was reminded of this reality when I was sitting in the examining room of a Bay Area hospital, where I was shadowing a physician.</description>
