      <p><strong>If you or a loved one is having thoughts of self-harm, there is help. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255</strong></p>
<p>To write these words is to challenge a belief I hold close to my soul: that language can express the full depth of the Human experience, and in particular, my own as I suffer the withdrawal symptoms of sertraline, a medication to which I became dependent on to soften the torments of my never-ending anxiety. Words have always failed me when I try to explain why my anxiety leaves me unable to function, and why this anxiety is not caused by anything I&rsquo;m thinking about. Yet this episode leaves me to conclude that when describing the insides of my head, words are inadequate.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that my breakup with sertraline was a protest against the pharmaceutical industry or a detox from all mind-altering substances. Yet this is not the case. A lapse in health insurance coverage (entirely due to my oversight) caused me to stop taking the drug. As a result, I am discontinuing sertraline without a doctor&rsquo;s approval; and because of my temporary lack of insurance, no doctor to confess my withdrawal symptoms to.</p>
<p>While my experience is common for those who stop taking sertraline — it is known as SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome — I did not anticipate such a diverse and weird set of symptoms over the past few days: upset stomach, fever, headache, fatigue, malaise, decreased appetite, and most peculiar of all, a zapping sensation in my brain. (Notice, though, a lack of anxiety; my mind must have a sense of humor.)</p>
<p>Sertraline (brand-name: Zoloft) is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). A neuroscientist will explain that this means the drug will increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, hopefully improving mood and other symptoms. A clinician will explain this drug is used to treat depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other afflictions. And I will explain that these descriptions are a poor exercise in intellectualization: my mind feels like a cauldron of capricious chemicals, upset by stochastic processes unbeknownst to myself, and that I resent Science for failing to provide more answers.</p>
<p>It has been five days since I stopped taking my anxiety medication. Because I have not had a relapse of the debilitating anxiety which led me to start taking it six months ago, I have decided to continue this experiment. I do not know when the withdrawal symptoms will end. Nor do I know when our society will treat psychiatric conditions with the same respect as somatic ones. Regardless, I hope both come soon — for my sake as much as yours.</p>
<p>In short, dear reader, do not stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. You may end up feeling electricity course through your cranium without your consent.</p>
