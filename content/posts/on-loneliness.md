I, like most people during the pandemic, was lonely during the pandemic. Unfortunately, even though lockdowns and social distancing have ended, my loneliness has not. I have struggled with loneliness all my life; however, this past year has been my loneliest ever.

Loneliness is common in our society, particularly in my demographic — young, recent college graduates — though I have the (probably mistaken) belief that mine is uniquely pernicious. One can never feel someone else's pain, but if I had to describe my loneliness, I would say I could feel it in my bones. 

During the pandemic, I had hoped my loneliness would end when the world returned to "normal." Now that the pandemic has "ended" and I am without close friends or meaningful social connections, I realize this hope was foolish. I suppose I never stopped social distancing.
