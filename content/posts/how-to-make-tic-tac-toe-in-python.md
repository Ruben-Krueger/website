## Motivation

Introductory coding tutorials are generally pretty good at teaching the basics of programming: loops, functions, variables, etc. However, after learning these fundamentals, I've heard from several people that it is unclear how they should continue their computer science education. At this point, I think it's best to take on a project.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python.

## Getting Started

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of programming (e.g., variables, functions, loops). 

### Mac

MacOS already ships with Python 2.7.

https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Windows



### Linux

If you're on Linux, you most likely have Python already [installed](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24802/on-which-unix-distributions-is-python-installed-as-part-of-the-default-install
). Besides, if you're on Linux, you probably already know what you're doing.


## Subproblems

When 


- Getting the player's moves
- Checking the state of the board (a win, cat's game, or in progress)
- Updating the board state
- 


## Coding the game

1. Setting up the file 


2. 



## Playing the game


## Conclusion



## Extensions



1. Our game assumes the player's input is correctly formatted (two valid indices separated by a comma). Can you write a program 
2. Our board is printed
