As I climbed another steep trail, muddy and filled with rocks — forcing me to walk, once again — I reminded myself *I signed up for this. I paid money to do this.*

To be sure, Tilden Regional Park is stunningly beautiful — a “crown jewel” park with miles of forest trails next to Berkeley — but this I could not enjoy, as I only looked forward to reuniting with my car, where I had stored coconut water and granola bars.  In fact, during most of the race, I kept my head down, focusing on not slipping in the East Bay clay mud (thankfully, I only tumbled once).

Normally I would not sign up for a half-marathon race — 13.1 miles is a distance I’ve run plenty of times before — but I wanted a “warm up” race before doing the full marathon distance again. 

The race started at 8:30 AM, after a race organizer gave us the instructions: *don’t leave trash and don’t get lost.* Standing there with the 50 or so other runners, this felt more like a Saturday group run than an official race to me. And that’s what I told myself, to ease my pre-race jitters (and calm my gut, which had been acting up that morning).

Our run started without much fanfare; a race organizer told us to begin running. We first jogged through a parking lot, then started climbing up a muddy trail. By the course’s end, we had gained 2,700 feet of elevation. During most of the race, I was near the front of the pack, though I was generally running alone. My solitude was intermittently interrupted by hikers also on the trail, who often shouted encouragement. I appreciated this greatly, especially when I thought I had taken the wrong turn, which happened a few times.

The last few miles were mostly downhill; unfortunately, descending trails has always been a weakness for me. This, combined with a regrettable fueling strategy (not stopping at any of the aid stations), allowed a few people to pass me near the end. Soon enough, though, I reached the final hill and crossed the finish line, placing 9th out of 51. Not bad, not great.

After crossing the finish line, there was an assemblage of runners and volunteers. Deliriously tired and thirsty — I did not drink any water during the run — an oasis appeared: two packs of beer on a picnic table. As I clumsily struggled to open one of the cases, a race organizer chided me: the beers are only for winners.

Oh, I should have known: *only winners deserve beer.*
