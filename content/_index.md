Hey! I'm a recent Stanford graduate in computer science. I'm currently working at [Sprinter Health](https://www.sprinterhealth.com/), a startup that is making blood draws, vitals checks, and other vital health services more accessible to all.

When I'm not coding, you may find me running, losing at chess, or writing.
