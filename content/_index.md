Hey! I'm a recent Stanford graduate. I'm currently working on Comet Healthcare (YC S21), a company that's bringing physical therapy into the 21st century. I'm passionate about health equity, social justice, and most of all, running.

I also love to write and thus a blog on science, technology, and politics. Care to check it out?
